# CS292-Project-Proposal
Room Scheduling

## Types of Solvers 

- Algorithmic Approach
- SMT Approach
- Multiple-Objective Double SMT 
- Multiple-Objective Static Weighted
- Multiple-Objective Dynamic Weighted

## Performance Evaluation

### Base Problem Objective
- Algorithmic Approach & SMT Approach
- Increase # of intervals, # of overlapping intervals, # of rooms 
- Expect that algorithm will be faster
- Looking more at how time increases w/ complexity (big O)

### Multiple Objective for Resource Utilization
- Multiple-Objective Double SMT 
- Multiple-Objective Dynamic Weighted
- (Multiple-Objective Static Weighted)

- Hypothesis: Double SMT will be slower, but will multiplication slow down weighted? 
- big discrepency in range -> maybe double SMT will be faster
